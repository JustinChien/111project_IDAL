We're trying to create a system that's able to asist Doc for Breast Cancer.
Currently Breast Cancer can be treated well if found early, and with X-Ray Images
we can found parts have a possibility to be a tumor.Yet there's another kind of
abnormal symptoms called Calcification. It does have a pattern for us to recognize
but size is the problem here.Calcification often form little white dots with a specific
pattern,but those Malignant ones are way too small to found easily.That's why this
project was start and the problem we're trying to solve.
